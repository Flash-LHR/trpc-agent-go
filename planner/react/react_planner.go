// Package react implements the React planner that constrains the LLM response to
// generate a plan before any action/observation.
//
// The React planner is specifically designed for models that need explicit
// planning instructions. It guides the LLM to follow a structured format with
// specific tags for planning, reasoning, actions, and final answers.
//
// Supported workflow:
//   - Planning phase with /*PLANNING*/ tag
//   - Reasoning sections with /*REASONING*/ tag
//   - Action sections with /*ACTION*/ tag
//   - Replanning with /*REPLANNING*/ tag when needed
//   - Final answer with /*FINAL_ANSWER*/ tag
//
// Unlike the built-in planner, this planner provides explicit planning
// instructions and processes responses to organize different content types.
